# Dealbreakers


## About

Dealbreakers is a multiplayer game based off the card game, Red Flags. Players take turn being the single person and will pick somebody to date and everybody else tries to build the perfect date that would seem to be a good match for the single person. The catch is the competing dates will sabotage each other by throwing in a dealbreaker to create a less than ideal date. Now you'll get some pretty flawed characters like:
> This person is an astronaut and laughs at all your jokes, but they're a flat earther

## Run and Build

## Technology
